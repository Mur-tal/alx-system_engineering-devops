## Shellcheck
[Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) is a tool that will help you write
proper Bash scripts. It will make recommendations on your syntax and semantics and provide
advice on edge cases that you might not have thought about. <b>Shellcheck</b> is your
friend! All your Bash scripts must pass <b>Shellcheck</b> without any error or you will
not get any points on the task.  
<b>Shellcheck</b> is available on the schoolâ€™s computers. If you want to use it on
your own computer, here is how to [install](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#installing)
